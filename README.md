Software project Python
Task: write a python code along side an interfacing library opc to create 6 different animations on 6 led bars while consistently updating the repository.
my code starts up with a black background and the user gets asked to input between a and f.
Each letter displays an animation.
If a is entered - a random flag i named benjo's kingdom flag shows up. It consists of for loops running from the outer edges to the centre. It is colored red green blue as it was my first animation which is basic.
When b is entered - 3 white groups of led form the clouds and blue leds which symbolise the rain fals from each cloud. Rain falls from a cloud at a time but would have loved it to move randomly but it was difficult for me to make the rain move randomly as expected even after researching.
When c is entered - there is a visual countdown from 3 to 0 within range 24, 31 and range 264, 273
When d is entered - the loops draw lines to create a small hut and then after a bigger hut
When e is entered - shows the sequence of a traffic light. Red lightning shows first then yellow and lastly green but did not code for it to move back to red. It is just an animation from red to green and it stops.
when f is entered - this dispays the few primary colours combination that adds up to make a secondary colour. 
When anything else apart from a to f is entered - you get an error message "That is not a valid input". 
The questions are asked infinitely after every animation is displayed and after an error response because of the whole code is under a while true loop.
